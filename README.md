# 04: Web APIs: Code Quiz

## INRODUCTION 

This application is a timed coding quiz with multiple -choice questions.  It will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.  

## REQUIREMENT

In the default page, this application must be able to execute a timer and execute multiple choice questions.  Upon completion, it will record user's score and retain high score information.

Language used:
* Html
* CSS
* JavaScript

## STEPS
Application is not working at the moment.

## CHALLENGES
Coming from a non-coder background, this is the most challenging one to construct.  It is not to disrespect the assigment, but the progress made with this assignment does not measure up with the amount of time spent churning the work.  The obstacles and hoops are not knowing how to apply proper tools known so far.
